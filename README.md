# Roblox dynamic reanimation
Roblox reanimation bypass with dynamic velocity

# What is Dynamic velocity?
Dynamic velocity is velocity, which is applied in the direction you, as player moves.
Dynamic velocity uses MoveDirection, which is then used to calculate direction to apply
velocity in.

# Why Dynamic velocity?
Lets say for example you use velocity of: Vector3.n(100,100,100) and you start moving.
This velocity is fine and won't jitter... That is if you dont move of course.
When you move your character, your physics get calculated in a way which makes you glitch
any time you move. Dynamic velocity fixes that. Dynamic velocity applies velocity in
direction player moves and it gives no space for jitter.

# Motivation
Exploiting on roblox has been on roblox for decade and people are still exploiting.
By increasing numbers of daily players on Roblox, alot more people MIGHT want to get
into exploiting.
The issue is that there arent any valid tutorials on exploiting exactly(that I know of).
This code is released publicly exactly for that reason: Learn & Code.

# Note
the coding style is snakecase, and if you might send commits, then code it in snakecase.
Much obliged.
